Codecademy Ready 'Tea Cozy' Project

This week's content was extremely difficult for me. Although I understand the ideas of flex-box and positioning, I'm still not sure where
to apply the commands (container vs. items), or how to justify content within containers, containers within other containers, etc. Basically,
I muddled through all of this, so I don't really expect detailed feedback. I get that my code isn't very good and that I need to practice
all of this.
